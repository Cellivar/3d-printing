# Cetus2 Configuration Files

I'm going to try and keep my configuration settings here, both to version control them and also to help other folks who might be trying to dial in this printer.

At some point I might dissect the configuration format and build a little webapp for tweaking the settings more easily than the UP Studio3's interface. If you would like to see that drop me a note somewhere!
