# Notes on UP Studio 3

UP Studio is the default slicer for Tiertime printers, including my Cetus2. This is my first 3D printer and I'm discovering that the software is less than the best on the market, regardless of how neat and generally alright the printer hardware is.

My exploration of this software has been involved enough that I feel the need to take notes so I can find my way back in the future. These docs are those notes.

I hope you find them useful.

* [Custom materials](materials.md)
