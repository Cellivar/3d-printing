# Cetus 2 Profile Setup

Tiertime released their [Cetus2 setup guide via a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSJX1s5Jaj8) and [an accompanying guide](https://support.tiertime.com/hc/en-us/articles/18541622274457-Use-Cura-to-Slice-for-Cetus2).

## Cura Profile 2023-04-17

This was the first profile they released. The initial release of firmware 1038 had issues and was supplemented with 1038-2 to fix them.

The setup guide is as follows:

1. [Download and update the printer to firmware 1038-2 at least](https://www.cetus3d.com/software/).
2. [Download and install Cura, at least version 5.3](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/).
3. If you're running Cura for the first time you will go through printer setup immediately.
  * If this is not your first time, open the Add a Printer screen with Settings -> Printer -> Add Printer
4. Expand the 'Add a non-networked printer' screen, select 'Custom', then 'Custom FFF printer'.
5. Update the printer name to something better, like `Cetus2`.
6. Hit Next.
7. You will be presented with a bunch of printer settings, which are detailed in the table below.
8.
