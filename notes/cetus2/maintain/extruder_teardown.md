# Extruder head fast teardown

This is a written set of instructions mostly following [the official teardown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V2NRECrV9I). This is focused on clog removal and PTFE tube inspection.

1. Unload both filaments
  * If you're planning on removing the nozzle you should immediately loosen the nut with the included wrench, remove the nut, and remove the nozzle with needle nose pliers. 
  * It will usually have an amount of old plastic holding it in otherwise.
  * Optional: Let it cool off with the fans running to make the rest of the process easier
3. Remove rainbow IDC connector between X axis and extruder head
4. Unscrew extruder head from X axis bracket
5. Unplug three white fan connectors from top of the extruder
6. [Carefully whack the shroud to loosen it](../extruder_v2.md#main-unit-and-disassembly) then slide it off
7. Remove the part cooling fan
8. Remove the four screws between the motor mounts and the heatsinks
9. Disconnect the yellow and red hotend connectors, set the motor assembly aside.

At this point the hotend assembly is separate and it should be easy to see where your clog or other problem is. The rest is for further teardown of the hotend in case you need to inspect the PTFE tubes or clear a persistent clog.

1. Remove the two filament guides on top of the heatsinks
2. Remove the extruder mounting bracket from the side of the heatsinks
3. Remove one of the two screws of the air deflection plate on the bottom of the heatsinks, the other can stay in.
4. Loosen but do not remove the heatsink clamping screws
5. Slide the heatsink up off of the hotend, noting that they are angled so will slide to the sides as the come up.
