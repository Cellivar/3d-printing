# Printer interface during printing

The printer has a limited interface during printing that lets you tweak settings on the fly to correct printing problems.

## Print Progress Menu

The default menu shows the current print progress, with two buttons for pause and settings.

The print progress timer doesn't match reality, and it wil sometimes 'catch up' depending on how the print is going. Notably it'll continue counting down while paused.

## Print Settings

Tapping the gear button will bring you to the print settings menu.
