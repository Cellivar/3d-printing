# Cetus2 Part Files

These are the Cetus2 printable parts files, originally from [the Cetus3D website](https://www.cetus3d.com/product-category/printables/cetus2-printables/).

These parts files are likely designed to be printed in ASA or ABS to withstand the heat, though some of the parts don't need to be able to deal with high temperatures.

On my printer all of the parts are printed in black, except for the wifi antenna cover that was printed in white.

## Custom Part Files

Several other parts of the printer are not 3D printed, but likely could be to improve things. If I take the plunge I'll be adding any files I create here as well.

* [Alternate filament feeder for TPU](https://www.printables.com/model/140887) that may fit on the Cetus2 extruder.
* [Another alternate filament feeder, with a spring and sized for a standard 11mm gear](https://www.printables.com/model/77611-cetus-mk3-new-idler-for-improved-extruder-gear). May not properly fit in a Cetus2 extruder, experiment needed!
