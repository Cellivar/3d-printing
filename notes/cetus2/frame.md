# Cetus2 Main Frame

## Bottom panel

Tiertime [has a video on replacing the mainboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO8WDFXOkRM) to help with this.

The bottom plate is attached with four M3-0.4x4 hex-head screws (2.5mm hex head). Two under the front and two at the very back. Two additional screws on the sdies between the feet are M4x0.8?x6 hex head (3mm hex head) just to keep you on your toes.

BE CAREFUL with the wifi antenna, which normally is glued to a plastic insert in the bottom panel. Dislodge the white plastic before pulling the panel off too far.

### General observations

* The main structure of the printer is extruded aluminum, leading ot a relatively low noise and strong structure to prevent vibration. This makes me more confident this printer has a lot of 'dial in' range for getting high quality prints.
* Most screws on my machine needed a little tightening down. I'm tempted to loctite some of the frame screws that shouldn't move very often.
* There is ample room towards the front of the unit for additional connectors on the side. It shouln't be particularly difficult to add nice-looking custom ports near thee exposed SD card and USB-C port, or on the opposite side.
* The wifi connection is a standard U.FL connector. If you're having significant problems with wifi on this printer it should be possible to modify it with a custom antenna routed along the same path as the filament sensor and mount it towards the top of the Z-axis plate. This should improve reception, especially in a basement or far-off garage.
