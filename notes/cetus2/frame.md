# Cetus2 Main Frame

## Bottom panel

Tiertime [has a video on replacing the mainboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO8WDFXOkRM) to help with this.

The bottom plate is attached with four M3-0.4x4 hex-head screws (2.5mm hex head). Two under the front and two at the very back. Two additional screws on the sdies between the feet are M4x0.8?x6 hex head (3mm hex head) just to keep you on your toes.
